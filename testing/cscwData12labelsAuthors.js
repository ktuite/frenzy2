After years of extensive search and research, a variety of intricate puzzles have been detected and resolved. However, it remains an open issue whether all puzzles have been discovered. To solve this issue, we set out to devise a verification framework and a software tool, that are able to exhaustively and efficiently cover all possible transformation cases in which puzzles (if any) will manifest themselves. With these tools, we verified OT correctness, made important discoveries and concluded: all puzzles, under basic data and operation models and established transformation properties, have been discovered and resolved.

Meanwhile, more and more web applications are visited on mobile devices. However, most existing commenting systems are not mobile ready. The intermittent connection of mobile networks poses great challenges to both smooth interaction and data consistency. On the one hand, smooth user interaction requires non-blocking commenting and high responsiveness. On the other hand, data consistency must be guaranteed due to the simultaneous commenting actions on the same thread. As an optimistic replication technique that achieves high responsiveness while maintaining consistency, group editing technique can well meet the system requirements of mobile commenting. In this paper, we propose a novel partial replication approach specially designed to provide smooth commenting experience on mobile devices. Users are allowed to freely comment anywhere anytime. The comment thread can be incrementally updated and automatically synchronized with strong data consistency guarantees.

We find that social media is a means of social network expansion by individuals, but also by advocacy and service organizations working on issues related to vision impairment. These narratives of social media use, in particular Facebook, illuminate three key themes. First, we find that existing physical networks provide an important segue into online social networks. Second we find that the online social media are an important means of expanding human networks in ways that were particularly difficult without access to technology. Finally we find that social media provide an important means of accessing the technological assistance and media. The article highlights the role of social media in a climate of economic and social marginalization that people with disabilities often face in regions that lack the infrastructure, legal provisions, and appropriate accessible technology for the inclusion of people with disabilities.<span id='less-abstract-cscw631' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>", "replyCounter": 0, "lastUpdateTime": 0, "replies": [], "labels": {"Legal/historical/philosophical aspects": {"dislikes": [], "checked": true, "likes": [], "lastUpdateTime": 123456789, "label": "Legal/historical/philosophical aspects"}, "Empirical Methods, Qualitative": {"dislikes": [], "checked": true, "likes": [], "lastUpdateTime": 123456789, "label": "Empirical Methods, Qualitative"}, "Cross-cultural Systems or Studies": {"dislikes": [], "checked": true, "likes": [], "lastUpdateTime": 123456789, "label": "Cross-cultural Systems or Studies"}, "Social Computing and Social Navigation": {"dislikes": [], "checked": true, "likes": [], "lastUpdateTime": 123456789, "label": "Social Computing and Social Navigation"}}, "creationTime": 422, "id": "cscw631"}, "cscw544": {"session": "none", "html": "<b>cscw544</b><br><b>Symp.ly Real-Time Collaboration System</b><br><span id='authorscscw544'>Wei Jia<br>Stephen Cooper<br></span><br> <span id='short-abstract-cscw544'> <b>Abstract: </b>In this paper, we describe a novel real-time collaboration system, Sym...<span id='more-abstract-cscw544' class='more-abstract'>(more)</span></span>   <span id='full-abstract-cscw544' > <b>Abstract: </b>In this paper, we describe a novel real-time collaboration system, Symp.ly that can be utilized both as a group collaboration tool, and as an individual task management tool. Existing productivity software has two main problems. First, they are either only effective for high level milestone and goal setting, or low level individual tasks; no collaboration tool solves both problems. Second, they generally do not provide real-time collaborative syncing with negligible time delay. Symp.ly solves both of these problems by providing an infinitely nestable hierarchical organizational structure, and fully integrated real-time syncing for both text and data structure. We also conducted an empirical study that demonstrated the viability and effectiveness of Symp.ly.

Lag compensation techniques have been proposed to try and maintain consistency. However, these techniques do not address all of the issues that arise due to diverging states. In particular, current understanding of consistency maintenance does not indicate how to make game-critical decisions when there are divergent views, nor does it indicate how to repair inconsistencies. These two issues \u2013 decision-making and error repair \u2013 can have substantial effects on how players view the game, but there is little information about these effects. To address this shortcoming, we carried out an experiment to test the effects of different choices. Our study confirms that decision-making and error repair can have significant effects on player experience and performance, and shows that that simple consistency is often not as important as these other factors. <span id='less-abstract-cscw190' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>", "replyCounter": 0, "lastUpdateTime": 0, "replies": [], "labels": {"Entertainment/games": {"dislikes": [], "checked": true, "likes": [], "lastUpdateTime": 123456789, "label": "Entertainment/games"}, "User experience/interaction design": {"dislikes": [], "checked": true, "likes": [], "lastUpdateTime": 123456789, "label": "User experience/interaction design"}, "Concurrency control": {"dislikes": [], "checked": true, "likes": [], "lastUpdateTime": 123456789, "label": "Concurrency control"}}, "creationTime": 40, "id": "cscw190"}, "cscw615": {"session": "none", "html": "<b>cscw615</b><br><b>To Risk or Not to Risk?

A crucial element for better management is the extent to which financial risk taking is rational \u2013 whether there is a reasonable balance between expected reward and loss in face of uncertainty. Financial networking websites, utilizing emerging Web 2.0 technologies, have the potential to help risk management by allowing users to learn from others. It is, however, still unclear whether they can help older adults make more rational decisions, especially because older adults are often vulnerable to poor risk management . Using an experiment expanded upon an existing experimental economic task, we investigated how older adults\u2019 investment decisions were affected by social information. We found that both peer and majority information could help older adults make more rational decisions. Furthermore, the more risk-averse an older adult was, the more influential the aggregates of social information became.

There are often complaints about the lack of replication studies in disciplines related to CSCW (particularly Software Engineering and HCI).  These complaints are usually embedded in wider attempts to install a principled scientific method within these disciplines.  This paper argues naturalistic research, including ethnography and interaction analysis, would also benefit from the kinds of activities advocated in the replication literature.  However, naturalistic approaches are incompatible with the broader scientific visions forwarded by the replication literature.
