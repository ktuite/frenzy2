Also our findings open up discussions about the professional identity of IT developers within GSD, which includes extending the qualifications for IT developers.<span id='less-abstract-cscw147' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>","replyCounter":0,"lastUpdateTime":1376918404016,"replies":[],"session":"none","labels":{"Distributed/virtual teams":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":1376918401386,"label":"Distributed/virtual teams"},"Empirical Methods, Qualitative":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":1376918402802,"label":"Empirical Methods, Qualitative"},"Cross-cultural Systems or Studies":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Cross-cultural Systems or Studies"},"Collaborative software development":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":1376918404016,"label":"Collaborative software development"}},"creationTime":1,"id":"cscw147"},"cscw145":{"content":{"shortAbstract":"Every day, thousands of people make donations to humanitarian, politic","authorList":["Yelena Mejova, Yahoo!","Venkata Garimella, Qatar Computing Research Institute","Ingmar Weber, Qatar Computing Research Institute"],"id":"cscw145","fullAbstract":"Every day, thousands of people make donations to humanitarian, political, environmental, and other causes, a large amount of which occur on the Internet.

By exploring how people decide whether to participate online or offline, the results illuminate the sophisticated nature of the mechanisms that affect participation and has design implications that can bridge virtual and real attendance.<span id='less-abstract-cscw119' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>","replyCounter":0,"lastUpdateTime":1376944600773,"replies":[],"session":"none","labels":{"Computer-Mediated Communication":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Computer-Mediated Communication"},"Empirical Methods, Qualitative":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Empirical Methods, Qualitative"},"Social Networking Site Design and Use":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Social Networking Site Design and Use"},"Social Media Offline":{"label":"Social Media Offline","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376922703415},"persuasion":{"label":"persuasion","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376935680105},"Parties & cocktail hour":{"label":"Parties & cocktail hour","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376942532354},"Upstate NY State of Mind":{"label":"Upstate NY State of Mind","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376939761422}},"creationTime":38,"id":"cscw119"},"cscw228":{"content":{"shortAbstract":"An increasing number of researchers are using social engagement techni","authorList":["Tawanna Dillahunt, University of Michigan","Jennifer Mankoff, Carnegie Mellon University"],"id":"cscw228","fullAbstract":"An increasing number of researchers are using social engagement techniques such as neighborhood comparison and competition to encourage energy conservation, yet community reception and experience with such systems have not been well studied.

Existing information systems (IS) tend to treat these different aspects of coordination separately, resulting in problems of awareness and coordination. In this paper, we present the concept of Articulation Spaces which combines aspects of Coordination Mechanisms and Common Information Spaces (CIS) in order to provide a room for mediating between the formal and informal aspects of coordination.

Existing information systems (IS) tend to treat these different aspects of coordination separately, resulting in problems of awareness and coordination. In this paper, we present the concept of Articulation Spaces which combines aspects of Coordination Mechanisms and Common Information Spaces (CIS) in order to provide a room for mediating between the formal and informal aspects of coordination. Based on a design study in the form of a lightweight public display, we test the concept in a medium-sized German software company with regard to its implications for coordination support and show how Articulation Spaces provide information for meta-coordination, raise awareness and facilitate serendipitous knowledge exchange.

We investigate how forum design affects student activity and learning outcomes through a field experiment with 1101 participants on the edX platform. We introduce a reputation system, which gives students points for making useful posts. We show that, as in other settings, use of forums in MOOCs is correlated with better grades and higher retention. Reputation systems additionally produce faster response times and larger numbers of responses per post, as well as differences in how students ask questions. However, reputation systems have no significant impact on grades, retention, or the students' subjective sense of community.

We investigate how forum design affects student activity and learning outcomes through a field experiment with 1101 participants on the edX platform. We introduce a reputation system, which gives students points for making useful posts. We show that, as in other settings, use of forums in MOOCs is correlated with better grades and higher retention. Reputation systems additionally produce faster response times and larger numbers of responses per post, as well as differences in how students ask questions. However, reputation systems have no significant impact on grades, retention, or the students' subjective sense of community. This suggests that forums are essential for MOOCs, and reputation systems can improve the forum experience, but other techniques are needed to improve student outcomes and community formation. We also contribute a set of guidelines for running field experiments on MOOCs. \\ <span id='less-abstract-cscw348' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>","replyCounter":0,"lastUpdateTime":1376918075810,"replies":[],"session":"none","labels":{"E-Learning and Education":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"E-Learning and Education"},"Community analysis and support, virtual or physical":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Community analysis and support, virtual or physical"},"MOOCs":{"label":"MOOCs","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376918075810}},"creationTime":12,"id":"cscw348"},"cscw188":{"content":{"shortAbstract":"Engagement, motivation and active contribution by digital volunteers a","authorList":["Chris Preist, University of Bristol","Elaine Massung, University of Bristol","David Coyle, University of Bristol"],"id":"cscw188","fullAbstract":"Engagement, motivation and active contribution by digital volunteers are key requirements for crowdsourcing and citizen science projects.

It can thus be risky to commit effort to a goal: participants arrive only to discover that nobody else came, and organizers devote significant effort to causes that never get off the ground. Crowdfunding lessens this risk by only calling in donations when an effort reaches a collective goal. However, it leaves unsolved the harder problem of mobilizing time and effort. We generalize the concept into activation thresholds, commitments that are conditioned on others’ participation: supporters only need to show up if enough other people commit as well.

It can thus be risky to commit effort to a goal: participants arrive only to discover that nobody else came, and organizers devote significant effort to causes that never get off the ground. Crowdfunding lessens this risk by only calling in donations when an effort reaches a collective goal. However, it leaves unsolved the harder problem of mobilizing time and effort. We generalize the concept into activation thresholds, commitments that are conditioned on others’ participation: supporters only need to show up if enough other people commit as well.

We present our findings as interplay between individual, community, organisational levels, public relations and media, the operational platform Foodsharing.de that enables local communities and the Facebook group where global ideological framing of the community takes place.<span id='less-abstract-cscw369' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>","replyCounter":0,"lastUpdateTime":1376946106192,"replies":[],"session":"none","labels":{"Social network analysis":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Social network analysis"},"Computer-Mediated Communication":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Computer-Mediated Communication"},"Empirical Methods, Qualitative":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Empirical Methods, Qualitative"},"Community analysis and support, virtual or physical":{"label":"Community analysis and support, virtual or physical","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376940270649},"Sustainability":{"label":"Sustainability","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376935047018},"values":{"label":"values","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376946106192}},"creationTime":109,"id":"cscw369"},"cscw409":{"content":{"shortAbstract":"What makes people happy, engaged and feeling challenged at work?

In characterizing this pattern, we contribute a set of implications for design and management that bear consideration by online community designers, developers, moderators, and end users. Ultimately this may lead to a smoother transition from community to community and ensure that social support needs are being met more consistently in response to changing life circumstances.<span id='less-abstract-cscw221' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>","replyCounter":0,"lastUpdateTime":1376942800580,"replies":[],"session":"none","labels":{"Computer-Mediated Communication":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Computer-Mediated Communication"},"Medical and health support":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Medical and health support"},"online support groups":{"label":"online support groups","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376933454736},"Corporate Research":{"label":"Corporate Research","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376940523098},"Pacific Northwest Rules!":{"label":"Pacific Northwest Rules!","checked":true,"likes":[],"dislikes":[],"lastTimeUpdated":1376942800580}},"creationTime":61,"id":"cscw221"},"cscw227":{"content":{"shortAbstract":"Human values play an important role in understanding social computing.","authorList":["Katie Shilton, University of Maryland","Jes A.

Using statistical analyses, and qualitative coding techniques, we explore trends of and motivations for conversations on the Warby Parker Facebook page. We show that contributors produce a broad range of content, from artistically edited photo collages and self-portraits to simple “likes” and one-to-three word comments, and in doing so leverage the Warby Parker Facebook page as a platform for creative self-expression, and socially driven decision-making.<span id='less-abstract-cscw462'

However, the complexity of informal caregiving has seldom been studied in prior research. In this study, we attempt to answer two main questions -- what makes the coordination of patient care so difficult among multiple informal caregivers, and what are the unique challenges to be considered in designing technologies to facilitate care coordination? To answer these questions, we conducted a qualitative interview study with individuals with caregiving experience. The findings of the study identified the main challenges faced by caregivers in handling patient-care information, namely: maintaining informational awareness and coordinating informational handoff. From these findings, we identified considerations that are unique to informal caregiver collaboration, and we outline opportunities for future technologies to support coordination of multiple informal caregivers.","title":"Handoffs and Awareness in Caregiving Process: Coordination among Informal Caregivers"},"html":"<b>cscw619</b><br><b>Handoffs and Awareness in Caregiving Process: Coordination among Informal Caregivers</b><br><span id='authorscscw619'>Yunan Chen<br>Karen Cheng<br>Victor Ngo<br></span><br> <span id='short-abstract-cscw619'> <b>Abstract: </b>Informal caregivers, such as family members and friends, are important...<span id='more-abstract-cscw619' class='more-abstract'>(more)</span></span>   <span id='full-abstract-cscw619' > <b>Abstract: </b>Informal caregivers, such as family members and friends, are important for maintaining the health and wellness of the elderly and chronic ill. However, the complexity of informal caregiving has seldom been studied in prior research. In this study, we attempt to answer two main questions -- what makes the coordination of patient care so difficult among multiple informal caregivers, and what are the unique challenges to be considered in designing technologies to facilitate care coordination? To answer these questions, we conducted a qualitative interview study with individuals with caregiving experience.

We discuss implications for theory and practice. <span id='less-abstract-cscw297' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>","replyCounter":0,"lastUpdateTime":0,"replies":[],"session":"none","labels":{"Computer-Mediated Communication":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Computer-Mediated Communication"},"Distributed/virtual teams":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Distributed/virtual teams"},"Organization/office/workplace support":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Organization/office/workplace support"}},"creationTime":85,"id":"cscw297"},"cscw199":{"content":{"shortAbstract":"Build, creating software from source code, is a fundamental activity i","authorList":["Shaun Phillips, University of Calgary","Thomas Zimmermann, Microsoft Research","Christian Bird, Microsoft Research"],"id":"cscw199","fullAbstract":"Build, creating software from source code, is a fundamental activity in software development.

However local community online interactions often fail to exceed the threshold of community perception, and people do not tend to consider microblogs content as a meaningful or informative stream. Local News Chatter (LNC) was designed to address these challenges by augmenting locally relevant news and aggregating hyperlocal microblog content. To empirically understand user experiences and design implications of LNC, we ran an exploratory user study with a total of 30 participants (15 students and 15 residents). Our study results highlight that LNC makes less prominent local community information visible and successfully utilizes microblog content as locally relevant information, increasing user experiences as well as satisfying different motivations and expectations in news consumption. LNC also helps to increase one’s community awareness and shows the potential for encouraging social interaction and engagement.","title":"Local News Chatter: Augmenting Community News by Aggregating Hyperlocal Microblog Content in a Tag Cloud"},"html":"<b>cscw583</b><br><b>Local News Chatter: Augmenting Community News by Aggregating Hyperlocal Microblog Content in a Tag Cloud</b><br><span id='authorscscw583'>Kyungsik (Keith) Han<br>Patrick Shih<br>John Carroll<br></span><br> <span id='short-abstract-cscw583'> <b>Abstract: </b>Being aware of local community information is critical to maintaining ...<span id='more-abstract-cscw583' class='more-abstract'>(more)</span></span>   <span id='full-abstract-cscw583' > <b>Abstract: </b>Being aware of local community information is critical to maintaining civic awareness and engagement.

This study can serve as a small yet significant first step to developing crowd-computer systems that harness the collective intelligence of crowd workers to evaluate crowdfunding campaigns.<span id='less-abstract-cscw498' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>","replyCounter":0,"lastUpdateTime":0,"replies":[],"session":"none","labels":{"Crowdsourcing":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Crowdsourcing"},"Social Computing and Social Navigation":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Social Computing and Social Navigation"}},"creationTime":155,"id":"cscw498"},"cscw394":{"content":{"shortAbstract":"Existing work on seniors and ICT often focuses on seniors as a sociall","authorList":["Yuling Sun, FUDAN UNIVERSITY","Xianghua Ding, Fudan University","Tun Lu, Fudan University","Ning Gu, Fudan University"],"id":"cscw394","fullAbstract":"Existing work on seniors and ICT often focuses on seniors as a socially isolated group with physical and cognitive decline.

Internet technologies are making it easier for the public to become involved and aware of scientific work, and scientists are becoming increasingly interested in using these technologies to engage the public. However, few avenues exist for the public to become involved in scientific research outside participating in large-scale citizen science projects. In this study, we analyze the recent Internet phenomenon of crowdfunding science. We interviewed 28 scientists in the crowdfunding science community to understand 1) Why scientists are motivated to crowdfund? and 2) How can we design crowdfunding platforms and support tools to help more scientists encourage public support for science projects? We find scientists are motivated and deterred to crowdfund for reasons related to acquiring financial resources, professional networking, engaging the public, skill development, and public validation.

Internet technologies are making it easier for the public to become involved and aware of scientific work, and scientists are becoming increasingly interested in using these technologies to engage the public. However, few avenues exist for the public to become involved in scientific research outside participating in large-scale citizen science projects. In this study, we analyze the recent Internet phenomenon of crowdfunding science. We interviewed 28 scientists in the crowdfunding science community to understand 1) Why scientists are motivated to crowdfund? and 2) How can we design crowdfunding platforms and support tools to help more scientists encourage public support for science projects? We find scientists are motivated and deterred to crowdfund for reasons related to acquiring financial resources, professional networking, engaging the public, skill development, and public validation. We conclude with a discussion and design implications on how to en-courage more scientists to engage the public in their re-search through crowdfunding.<span id='less-abstract-cscw591' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>","replyCounter":0,"lastUpdateTime":0,"replies":[],"session":"none","labels":{"Crowdsourcing":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Crowdsourcing"},"Empirical Methods, Qualitative":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Empirical Methods, Qualitative"},"Community analysis and support, virtual or physical":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Community analysis and support, virtual or physical"}},"creationTime":182,"id":"cscw591"},"cscw384":{"content":{"shortAbstract":"We present a computer supported tool for cooperative work in interdisc","authorList":["Lisa Miller, University of Hawaii at Manoa","Susanne Still, University of Hawaii","Rich Gazan, University of Hawaii at Manoa"],"id":"cscw384","fullAbstract":"We present a computer supported tool for cooperative work in interdisciplinary fields, which we applied to and tested within the area of astrobiology. \\ Our document classification and visualization system is fully automated and data driven, based on unsupervised machine learning algorithms that make minimal \\ assumptions about the data, and network visualization tools.

By contrasting these processes in Mozilla and Python, we identify their differences of contribution styles, reporting motivations, decision-making processes, division of labor, and uses of tools. We further articulate design implications for OSS projects that are advancing towards their maturity.<span id='less-abstract-cscw554' class='less-abstract'>(less)</span></span>","replyCounter":0,"lastUpdateTime":0,"replies":[],"session":"none","labels":{"Organization/office/workplace support":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Organization/office/workplace support"},"Community analysis and support, virtual or physical":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Community analysis and support, virtual or physical"},"Empirical Methods, Qualitative":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Empirical Methods, Qualitative"},"Collaborative software development":{"dislikes":[],"checked":true,"likes":[],"lastUpdateTime":123456789,"label":"Collaborative software development"}},"creationTime":170,"id":"cscw554"},"cscw637":{"content":{"shortAbstract":"Virtual environments facilitate group collaboration through avatars.

While many studies have examined the effects of avatar attributes on users’ behaviors and attitudes, few have explicitly tested how elements of avatar design relate to group collaboration satisfaction.  The present study fills this gap using data from a field study with student groups in a collaborative virtual environment.  Avatar customization count was found to relate to more satisfaction with group collaboration, as did the extent to which the user expressed personal identity through the avatar.  Although other types of connections to avatars were not found to relate to group collaboration satisfaction, they did relate to avatar face similarity, suggesting that these constructs may be important to other elements of avatar use besides group collaboration. These findings also suggest that virtual group collaboration environments could improve satisfaction by encouraging users to customize their avatars, especially to reflect personal identity.
