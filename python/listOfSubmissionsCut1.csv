In the process, clinicians use various artefacts amongst which medical records are central. Decades of experience is embedded in the structure and use of paper-based records. However, the development of electronic patient records (EPR) will change both structure and use of medical records, including ‘achieving overview’. We conducted an ethnographic study in a hospital ward using paper-based medical records in order to understand how clinicians achieve overview’.

Crowdfunding lessens this risk by only calling in donations when an effort reaches a collective goal. However, it leaves unsolved the harder problem of mobilizing time and effort. We generalize the concept into activation thresholds, commitments that are conditioned on others’ participation: supporters only need to show up if enough other people commit as well. We present Catalyst, which introduces activation thresholds for on-demand events. For complex coordination needs, Catalyst also includes thresholds for time and role. Catalyst users have organized events including volunteering, on-demand study groups, and mass participation events like a human chess game.

However, we know little about the nature of these other-generated face threats and the ways that people perceive them. Using an online survey of 150 Facebook users, we report on what these users consider to be other-generated face threats and how they feel after experiencing them. Results suggest that many face threats result from other Facebook users neglecting or misunderstanding a target’s audience and/or self-presentation goals, as well as a target’s fear of creating an unwanted association with another Facebook user.

We show that, as in other settings, use of forums in MOOCs is correlated with better grades and higher retention. Reputation systems additionally produce faster response times and larger numbers of responses per post, as well as differences in how students ask questions. However, reputation systems have no significant impact on grades, retention, or the students' subjective sense of community.

These results informed the development of a model showing that online network size interacts with other media usage to predict who is highly assessed in the organization.

We then apply this model to the recent controversy over the location-aware mobile app Girls Around Me, which, when examined with an eye for policy’s interaction with design and users, turns out to be a multi-layered issue involving the intentions app designers, the policies of platforms like Foursquare and Facebook.  Finally, we examine policy negotiations in the case of Google Buzz and the privacy complaint issued in response by the Federal Trade Commission. ",,

These websites also seek to coordinate donations so that each project receives enough money to actually succeed. Each crowdfunding project sets a goal for donations required and a deadline in which to receive them. Crowdfunding site designers must decide what to do with donations to projects that don't reach their goal by the deadline. Some crowdfunding sites use an all-or-nothing return rule in which donations are returned to donors if a project doesn't met its goal. Other sites use a direct donation structure where all donations are kept by the project even if the total is insufficient.  Using a lab experiment that simulates a crowdfunding website, we find that the return rule mechanism leads to a marginal improvement in productivity, but a considerable loss in efficiency. The direct donation model, though, encourages donors to coordinate.",,

Experiments on 13 million global, comprehensively multi-lingual tweets show that our approach yields reliable, well-calibrated results competitive with previous computationally intensive methods. We also show that a relatively small number of training data are required for good estimates (roughly 30,000 tweets), and models are quite time-invariant (effective on tweets many weeks newer than the training set).

This paper explores this question by comparing two alternatives: aggregating content based on the source in which it is published, and aggregated content based on the issue to which it pertains. Here, we focus on how these two different aggregation methods support frame reflection, the ability to consider alternative framings of a given political issue, in the context of healthcare. The results suggest that issue-based aggregation significantly impacts participants’ demonstrated capacity for frame reflection, but they provide little evidence that source-based aggregation is helpful. These results not only contribute the literature on framing and on supporting frame reflection, but they also provide valuable implications and future directions for the design of interactive tools applying computational analysis to political content.",,

In particular, current understanding of consistency maintenance does not indicate how to make game-critical decisions when there are divergent views, nor does it indicate how to repair inconsistencies. These two issues – decision-making and error repair – can have substantial effects on how players view the game, but there is little information about these effects. To address this shortcoming, we carried out an experiment to test the effects of different choices. Our study confirms that decision-making and error repair can have significant effects on player experience and performance, and shows that that simple consistency is often not as important as these other factors.

Research on values in social computing is challenged by disagreement about indicators and objects of study as researchers distribute their focus across contexts of technology design, adoption, and use. This paper draws upon a framework that clarifies how to see values in social computing research by describing values dimensions, comprised of sources and attributes of values in sociotechnical systems. This paper uses the framework to compare how diverse research methods employed in social computing surface values and make them visible to researchers. The framework provides a tool to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method for observing values dimensions. By detailing how and where researchers might observe interactions between values and technology design and use, we hope to enable researchers to systematically identify and investigate values in social computing.

This paper argues there has been value in recreating Plans and Situated Actions (specifically in being able to explore laboratory issues unexplored in the original, and in understanding the book as being about more than instruction following).

Whether or not they will eventually replace books or merely complement them, there is a concern that something important might be lost in moving from print to digital books. While there is a wealth of research into the challenges and opportunities of e-reading, there is little research aiming to understand the broader role of books in everyday life. Rather than speculating on what books are in the digital age, in this paper, we wish to ask what books do. To do so, we conducted a series of in-depth interviews with ten UK households to understand everyday uses of books. Our findings suggest that books are not merely reading technologies but a resource for everyday social and personal engagements. We discuss implications of re-framing books as social technologies for the design of e-books. ",,

One benefit of such a system is that students receive quick responses to their questions from peers. However, seeing instructors’ answers may discourage students from contributing. We implemented a delay in the publication of instructors' answers to encourage student participation. We also implemented a technique to automatically identify ""expert"" students from their question asking and answering behaviors, and a point-based reward system. We evaluated Green Dolphin in a course and compared its usage with that of Piazza. We found that delaying instructor answers increased students’ participation, the reward system motivated students, and students felt pride in being identified by Green Dolphin as an expert. ",,

The results supported this prediction: high phone attachment individuals anticipated more pain than low phone attachment individuals when separated from their phone. We also found that high phone attachment individuals were more likely to be younger and to own a smartphone than a regular phone; we found no difference between genders.

We suggest that institutionalized logics of U.S. healthcare are embedded in the EMR design itself, structuring how “safety” is achieved and evaluated. Using over one year of ethnographic research in an obstetrical unit, we find that the institutional logics of “safety” embedded in the EMR create negative organizational outcomes, undermining coordination and necessitating inaccurate accounts of work.

The study was conducted in context of a popular open source content management system. Through interviews, we identified different types of contributions and perceptions of how these contributions are valued. We then quantified how contributions are valued based on analyzing exchanges of acknowledgment in the discussions. Our analysis revealed that valued contributions are beyond software development and include social support and collaborations. We also found that senior members more often value different contribution types than junior members. Finally, our analysis indicates that designer contributions are valued less often than developer contributions. Based on our results, we formulated implications for open source communities that want to improve the sense of contribution among members with different roles.",,

We focus specifically on the use of Facebook, where benefits included keeping in touch with friends and family abroad and documenting everyday urban life. At the same time, many participants also reported experiences of fatigue, socio-cultural tensions and concerns about maintaining a sense of personal privacy. These experiences highlight how transnational practices complicate context collapse, where the geographic dispersal of participants’ personal networks renders visible conflicts of “flattened” online networks. Our findings also suggest a kind of technology-enabled code-switching, where transnational migrants leverage social media to perform identities that alternate between communities, nationalities and geographies. This analysis informs HCI research on transnationalism and technological practices, as well as the complexities of online identity work in terms of shifting social and spatial contexts.",,

Based on interviews with community leaders and quantitative analysis of 128 online community spaces, we explored the combined use of six social software tools—wikis, blogs, forums, social bookmarks, social file repositories, and task-management tools. Our contributions involve characterizing combined technology use by communities and adding to our understanding of online community behaviors: Communities combine social tools to create complex information spaces. When combined, each tool is used for restricted ‘core’ functions. Thus, “social” features are not always leveraged for every tool. Our results suggest that an important overlooked aspect of social media concerns how these different tools can be effectively combined. While most prior work on communities emphasizes end user content, we identify additional important design activities where community leaders curate and combine pre-existing content from multiple tools to serve their community needs.",,

To better understand why a campaign succeeds (or fails), we examined the idea of using crowd workers to evaluate crowdfunding campaigns. We found that, although individual crowd workers are in general not good at predicting whether a campaign will succeed, combining their judgments on different aspects of the campaigns with a complex nonlinear machine learning model can predict if a campaign reaches its funding goal with up to 90% accuracy. This is significantly higher than the accuracy achieved by only machine learning techniques (77.5%) or only human judgments (72.5%).

However, our survey study of 116 Facebook users shows that privacy concerns are indirectly related to the frequency of Facebook use and one’s emotional attachment to Facebook through the frequency in which one engages with his or her friends using tagging and apps.

To better understand the impact of virtuality a study was conducted with 175 students in 50 teams to examine the complex and codependent effects of virtuality.  Results indicate that although geographic dispersion and perceived differences can undermine team identification, reliance on electronic communications increases team identification and weaken the negative relationship between perceived differences and team identification. Surprisingly, the positive relationship between reliance on electronic communications and team identification was stronger for collocated teams than for dispersed teams. Also, the results confirm that team identification enhances team performance, regardless of the level of geographic dispersion, reliance on electronic communications, and perceived differences.  ",,

English sentences with poor grammar can result from both a partner’s lack of fluency and errors in the MT process.

By means of a proxy-technology assessment and a series of interviews, collaborative challenges for telesurgery have been identified. These include the unfamiliarity of the remote surgeon with the practices of the local operating room team and the patient. In addition, verbal and non-verbal communication have to be mediated in a telesurgery setting, making it difficult for the remote surgeon to have an overview and stay in control during surgery. With this research, we illustrate how trust issues in distributed teams manifest in OR teams in a telesurgery setting.",,

Requesters can hire peer workers to review others’ work, but the value may be marginal, especially if the reviewers lack requisite knowledge. Our research explores if and how workers learn and improve their performance in a task do-main by serving as peer reviewers. Further, we investigate whether peer reviewing may be more effective in teams where the reviewers can reach consensus through discussion. An online between-subjects experiment compares the tradeoffs of reviewing versus producing work using three different organization strategies: working individually, working as an interactive team, and aggregating individuals into nominal groups. The results show that workers who review others’ work perform better on subsequent tasks than workers who just produce. We also find that interactive reviewer teams outperform individual reviewers on all quality measures. However, aggregating individual reviewers into nominal groups produces better quality assessments than interactive teams, except in task domains where discussion helps overcome individual misconceptions.

Responsiveness to these requests for help is important to study because these interactions may affect users’ overall satisfaction with the experience of using SNSs, signal social grooming functions essential to relationship maintenance, and affect social capital processes. In this paper, we study a corpus of public status updates posted to Facebook (N=7,466) in order to identify the pattern of responses to status updates that attempt to mobilize resources from the poster’s Facebook network. Findings suggest that mobilization requests are treated differently than other kinds of posts; posts that attempt to mobilize help receive more comments than non-mobilization attempts. Additionally, responses occur more quickly and are shaped by the type of support requested (e.g., a recommendation vs. a favor). These findings help us better understand the role of help-seeking behaviors in the social capital conversion process as it unfolds via social media.",,

In a month-long field trial with six participants from an art-related interest group, we found that SignUP provided positive support to increase seniors’ engagement in the local events and social connection with existing peers. We present detailed qualitative results from the evaluation study and provide insights on the enhancement of SignUP as a technology to facilitate seniors’ communication and coordination for local event participation.

We hypothesize that there are identifiable communicative signatures of speech volume and body movement, called bursts, which correlate with one another. Additionally, we posit that increased speech volume and body movement by an “ego” member or by team members can predict ego idea generation. To test these hypotheses, a Visually Integrated Cyber-enabled Design (V-ICED) system is used in conjunction with real-time sociometric data collected via wearable sociometric badges. Our findings support the presence of bursts indicated by communicative markers and suggest that participant speech volume and body movement positively correlate with one another. Additionally, the findings indicate ego speech volume and body movement predict ego idea sharing, and that alter speech volume may predict ego idea sharing, but that alter body movement activity does not. Implications for brainstorming in engineering design contexts are discussed.",,

Under such conditions, plans and planning assume a central role and challenge. Plans bridge and coordinate rhythms and events emanating from the organizational, infrastructural, biographical and phenomenal dimensions of collaborative life. Plans align rhythms embedded in local practice with those operating at larger institutional levels, and establish shared temporal baselines around which local choice and action may be calibrated. This paper develops these arguments through ethnographic study of the Ocean Observing Initiative, a prominent U.S.-based large-scale long-term collaborative research program in the ocean sciences. We emphasize the intersection between rhythms and plans at two crucial moments: formation (‘plans-in-the-making’), and enactment (‘plans-in-action’) across complex fields of practice. Our findings hold important implications for CSCW research and practice around scientific and large-scale collaborative efforts, and for federal science policies meant to support productive forms of cooperation and discovery.",,
