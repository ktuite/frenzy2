cscw100,,Social Networking Site Use by Recent Mothers,Meredith,Morris,merrie@microsoft.com,yes,,Meredith Morris,Meredith,Ringel,Morris,merrie@microsoft.com,,Microsoft Research,Redmond,Washington,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Social Networking Site Design and Use; Social Computing and Social Navigation; Home/family/intimacy support,"In this paper, we present the first formal study of how recent mothers (of children aged three and under) use social networking sites, particularly Facebook and Twitter, including mothers’ perceptions of which SNSes are appropriate for sharing information about their children, changes in post style and frequency after birth, and the volume and nature of child-related content shared in these venues. Our findings have implications for improving the utility and usability of SNS tools for recent mothers, as well as for creating and improving sociotechnical systems related to maternal and child health.

cscw104,,Socio-technical Trajectories: A Structural Framework for Analyzing Event Log Data,Brian,Keegan,b.keegan@neu.edu,yes,,"Brian Keegan, Darren Gergle",Brian,C,Keegan,b.keegan@neu.edu,,Northeastern University,Boston,Massachusetts,United States,Darren,,Gergle,dgergle@northwestern.edu,,Northwestern University,Evanston,Illinois,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Social network analysis; Social Computing and Social Navigation; Empirical Methods, Quantitative; Studies of Wikipedia/Web","Socio-technical systems like Wikipedia and GitHub encode a variety of implicit relationships within the digital traces of their user contributions. While prevailing social network analysis approaches can capture explicitly declared relationships, they ignore contextual and time-dependent interactions pervasive in social computing systems. We propose a method to recover these more implicit relationships from these archived event log data to identify the ``trajectories'' of both users and artifacts as they progress through the system over time.  This socio-technical trajectory framework provides an intermediate structural representation by reducing melding large quantitative analyses of digital trace data into more parsimonious representations. In particular, these structural signatures reveal regularities in action as well as anomalies in the behavior of users and artifacts that can motivate follow-on qualitative investigations of social roles, communities of practice, and institutional repertoires of action. We evaluate the mixed method potential of this approach with case studies of user and project activity on two large and noisy socio-technical systems, GitHub and Wikipedia.",,

In observing people’s interactions in the “sprawling public” sphere across multiple social media tools (in both political and non-political spaces), we found that social media supported the interactional dimensions of deliberative democracy—the interaction with media and the interaction between people. Social media supported people’s interaction with media as people used multiple tools through which they: were serendipitously exposed to diverse political information, constructed diverse information feeds, and disseminated information. Social media also supported people’s interactions with others, as people used multiple tools to engage in respectful and reasoned political discussions with diverse audiences. When one tool was lacking people often adopted or re-appropriated another tool. On a deeper level, we discuss how these interactions can have a depolarizing effect on the political beliefs and attitudes in the public sphere.",,

The field study is of global software development that entails or rests on the creation of a multitude of specialized documents taking their meaning from their position in an ensemble of documents, used or produced serially or in parallel, and usually by many people working together. The concept of documentscape refers to the entire ensemble of documents, in their mutual intertextual interlocking. We will argue that the effect of the intertextual relations between the documents constituting the documentscape is to draw the globally distributed activities of working with the documents together. In introducing the concept of documentscape, this paper outlines an approach to the investigation and conception of ensembles of documents in highly distributed cooperative work practices.",,

We interviewed 27 residents of the state of Hawaii who had integrated one or more social media tools into their daily lives so as to participate in the online public sphere by disseminating information and engaging with others. We found that users were utilizing social media to satisfy outward and inward motivations. On the one hand, people chose media so as to satisfy the needs of others (outward motivations) through the dissemination of information, and by calling people to action. On the other hand, people chose social media to satisfy their own needs (inward motivations) for social connectedness, sensemaking, catharsis and entertainment. Media choice and satisfaction were tied to people’s perception of the audiences within any particular media.",,
cscw120,DRT,Critical Reflection: A Visualization of Computer Use in K-12 Education,Rona,Sagi,ronasagi@gmail.com,yes,,Rona Sagi,Rona,,Sagi,ronasagi@gmail.com,Interaction Design Lab,University of Queensland,St. Lucia brisbane,Queensland,Australia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,User experience/interaction design; Workflow management; Other domain-specific support; Organization/office/workplace support,"Education researchers are identifying discrepancies between designers intentions, or technological capability, and the practical implementation of computers in the classroom. Studies in k-12 education show that teachers often use computers in traditional pedagogical practices, far from the powerful learning environment envisioned by so many. This work addresses the concern of the education community by proposing a new, sustainable and time effective solution that reduces the reliance on traditional training. Inspired by sociocultural approaches and value-centred HCI principals, a new digital artefact has been designed for the professional development of teachers. The Reflective Computing Interface (RCI) is a customisable visualisation of personal computing analytics. The visualisation applies an inclusive approach to technology design by providing access to information that has traditionally marginalised the common personal computer user. ",,

However, its utility is limited by lack of geographic information; for example, fewer than 1.6% of Twitter messages (tweets) contain a geotag. We propose a scalable, content-based approach to estimate the location of tweets using a novel yet simple variant of gaussian mixture models tuned for this task. Further, given that real-world applications depend on quantified uncertainty of such estimates, we propose novel metrics of accuracy, precision, and calibration, and we evaluate our approach accordingly. Experiments on 13 million global, comprehensively multi-lingual tweets show that our approach yields reliable, well-calibrated results competitive with previous computationally intensive methods. Our results also show that a relatively small number of training data are required for good estimates (roughly 30,000 tweets), and trained models are quite time-invariant (effective on tweets many weeks newer than the training set). Finally, we offer an analysis of which content types provide the best location signals.",,

The Basic Human Values, a motivational construct that captures people's values, have been shown to influence a wide range of human behaviors. In this work, we analyze people's values and their word use on Reddit, an online social news sharing community. Through conducting surveys and analyzing text contributions of 799 Reddit users, we identify and interpret categories of words that are indicative of user’s value-orientations. Using the same data we further report a preliminary exploration on word-based prediction of Basic Human Values.",,

However, relatively little attention has been paid to exactly how that content is aggregated for analysis. This paper explores this question by comparing two alternatives: aggregating content based on the source in which it is published, and aggregated content based on the issue to which it pertains. Here, we focus on how these two different aggregation methods support frame reflection, the ability to consider alternative framings of a given political issue, in the context of healthcare. The results suggest that issue-based aggregation significantly impacts participants’ demonstrated capacity for frame reflection, but they provide little evidence that source-based aggregation is helpful. These results not only contribute the literature on framing and on supporting frame reflection, but they also provide valuable implications and future directions for the design of interactive tools applying computational analysis to political content.",,

We particularly investigated how people with different personality exhibited different reply and retweet behaviors on Twitter. Our analysis considered scenarios when such social engagements involve friends or strangers in social network.  We also found personality attributes that show significant correlations with such social engagement behaviors. In addition, we have built predictive models of responses and retweets based on such personality attributes. Our experiments using two real world datasets validate our findings. ",,

Here we explore two major research questions using Facebook data: Do conversion topics influence the friending behavior? Do people talk to friends differently? The principle of homophily suggests that people tend to befriend others with shared characteristics, such as similar interests or social circles. We present an analysis from an egocentric viewpoint, revealing that friends who favor similar conversation topics form dense, growing, and isolated clusters. The selection of content about which one communicates with another is related with not only the individual interests but also the strength of social tie in-between. Our finding hints at many potential applications in modern social network sites, including content recommendation, news ranking, friends grouping, and social circle detection. As a demonstration of prospective uses, we succeed to infer individual topical preference with a good accuracy using content popularity, structure of local neighborhood, and social tie strengths.",,

To accommodate the diversity, recent developments in the field of learning systems have led to adaptive-personalised learning which considers learner models when performing pedagogical-related decisions. As a consequence, learning designers are required to create learning content, pedagogical knowledge, adaptation rules, learner model, and interfaces to support adaptation and personalisation. Hence, collaboration among learning designers is important. A challenge emerges as learning designers view learning from various pedagogical dimensions, which make it potentially fall into a fail when they can not find a concensus. This paper discusses our study on authors’ collaboration in authoring adaptive-learning resources. The study was specifically focused on how learning designers approach collaborative authoring of pedagogical knowledge and learner models and in which level of granularity learning designers can work collaboratively.",,

With this shift comes a need to understand how such displays should best be designed to encourage community members to engage and interact with the displays. We examine this by exploring prominent non-digital interactive displays in society, namely community bulletin boards, as cultural artifacts “in the wild.” Our results highlight the ways in which bulletin boards are used for content of local relevance and how cultures of participation, architecture, location, and personalization affect community members’ interactions with the boards.  This suggests key design considerations, each intrinsically linked to the users’ sense of agency within a delineated physical space. We discuss them in relation to geographic relevance, contextual relevance, and entry points for action and participation. ",,

While research in CSCW has studied how specific social cues might facilitate collaboration in specific tasks, such as the role of gestures in video instruction, how a range of communicative cues might facilitate activities across many collaborative settings is unknown. In this paper, we model the predictive relationships between facial, gestural, and vocal cues and collaborative outcomes in three different tasks, drawing conclusions on how each cue might contribute to these outcomes in a given task and how such relationships generalize across tasks. The results highlight differences in \ how collaborators use gaze, the importance of shared context for some tasks, and how different gestures (particularly deictic gestures) facilitate collaborative outcomes. Our findings offer key theoretical and design insights.",,

In this paper, we describe a comprehensive large-scale data-driven study of donation behavior. We analyze a two-month anonymized email log from several perspectives motivated by past studies on charitable giving: demographics, user interest, external time-related factors and social network influence. We show that email captures the demographic peculiarities of different interest groups, for instance, predicting demographic distributions found in US 2012 Presidential Election exit polls. Furthermore, we find that people respond to major national events, as well as to solicitations with special promotions, and that social connections are the most important factor in predicting donation behavior. Specifically, we identify trends not only for individual charities and campaigns, but also for high-level categories such as political campaigns, medical illnesses, and humanitarian relief. Thus, we show the extent to which large-scale email datasets reveal human donation behavior, and explore the limitations of such analysis.",,

Given that they are at the core of many applications, push notifications frequently compete for the user’s attention. The goal of this work is to gain an understanding of how notifications affect our daily lives.  \ In this paper, we report the results of a one-week, in-situ study, where we collected real-world log data and daily diaries from 15 information workers.  \ We found that notifications are frequent and a source of interruption and social pressure. Reasons are that mobile phones travel between private and work domain, and connect us with the people we care as well as with our work emails. However, our results indicate that rather than reducing the number of notifications, there are opportunities in delivering messages through the right channels at the right time.",,

Drawing on video extracts and observations from field visits collecting over a period of seven months, this paper explores how parents and children engage collaboratively with media during car journeys. We discuss the difficulties around keeping children occupied in the car while examining the interactions and media appropriations that take place within this context. We conclude with a discussion of how technology design could be enriched by better attending to the social interactions and family practices around media use in the car.",,

Social features in these venues are important for users’ success in making healthy behavioral changes. One reason for this is that even minimal social support can provide psychosocial resources that help people cope with challenging circumstances. An experiment tested this idea in a social media context by priming a person to think about social support by sending a text message to a friend before being tempted to eat unhealthy food. Findings show that participants who sent a content-neutral text message to a friend ate less unhealthy food compared to participants who saved the message in their phone. The social support effect was bounded by a participant’s stress level, suggesting that although a text message prime can influence eating, the effect is limited. Implications for research in computer-mediated communication, social support, and design are discussed. ",,

Hitherto this hypothesis remains empirically difficult to test. Based on the political science literature on selective exposure, we derive a set of hypotheses on what we call partisan sharing-the tendency for users to predominantly share like-minded news articles. We test these hypotheses upon both news articles shared on Facebook, and opinions shared on a political website we built.

We collect votes from more than 3K individuals and translate them into quantitative measures of urban perception (i.e., of aesthetic capital). By then using state-of-the-art image processing techniques,  we determine the visual cues that make a place appear beautiful, quiet, and happy. The amount of greenery is the most positively associated visual cue with each of three qualities; by contrast, broad streets,  fortress-like buildings, and council houses tend to be negatively associated.

Yet,  little is known about how or why one's stated preferences conflict with one's actual preferences. Our goal is to inform the design of exposure-aware systems by studying (1)~the extent to which people's pre-specified sharing settings diverge from their in situ sharing decisions; (2)~the level of comfort or disagreement with automated system decisions based on stated preferences; and (3)~various contextual factors that contribute to such divergence.

In particular, current understanding of consistency maintenance does not indicate how to make game-critical decisions when there are divergent views, nor does it indicate how to repair inconsistencies. These two issues – decision-making and error repair – can have substantial effects on how players view the game, but there is little information about these effects.

Conventional e-mentoring systems have expanded to social mentoring, including computer-mediated mentoring systems based on the power of crowd-sourcing and social media, although the most suitable types of interactions for achieving good communication during mentoring have not been addressed. In previous studies, we discovered that social mentoring requires a moderate psychological distance between the mentor and mentee. Thus, we developed t-echo, which is a calendar-based mentoring system that facilitates mentorship based on the requirements of the mentee, what they have done previously, and what they have time to do. Our final aim is to achieve an intergenerational mentoring system based on t-echo. As a preliminary step, we conducted a field study using laboratory members. In this paper, we answer the following questions. 1) Does t-echo facilitate intergenerational mentoring? 2) Is SNS like communication necessary for calendar-based mentoring? 3) How much should we be concerned about privacy during calendar-based mentoring?",,

However, most of existing social search engines are not designed for location-based queries and thus often produce poor-quality results for such queries. Glaucus is inherently designed to support location-based queries. It collects the check-in information, which pinpoints the places where each user visited, from location-based social networking services such as Foursquare. Then, it calculates the expertise of each user for a query by using our new probabilistic model called the location aspect model. We conducted two types of evaluation to prove the effectiveness of our engine. The results showed that Glaucus selected the users supported by stronger evidence for the required expertise than an existing social search engine. In addition, the answers from the experts selected by Glaucus were highly rated by our human judges in terms of answer satisfaction.",,

The framework provides a tool to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each method for observing values dimensions.

Users who participant in the definition of a workflow offer their own requirements of the workflow execution. Each user can selectively contributes to part of the workflow definition. The conflicts between requirements from different users can be detected automatically. A single flow control construct such as AND-join or OR-split can be comprised of requirements from multiple users. We implement a translator of the proposed language so that we can translate requirements collected from multiple users to other workflow definition languages.,,

It elicits rankings through a pairwise comparison approach. The fun element of games makes the task more enjoyable and durable. Thus this gaming approach mitigates the scaling issue of pairwise comparisons. An experimental study is conducted to examine the construct validity. The results show that the game-elicited rankings have a high similarity with the data-driven rankings. Also, at the puzzle level, players' performance is significantly better than chance. These findings support the hypothesis that the game provides a valid tool for ranking elicitation.",,

Using ethnographic research in an obstetrical unit, we find that institutional logics of “safety through systems” embedded in the EMR creates a “tight coupling” of coordinating and accounting functions.

Through use of health behavior models as a lens for interaction design, researchers and designers can more effectively diagnose why it is that people do or do not gravitate toward a given technological creation, and thus target interventions that are more appropriate to the needs and preferences of user groups—regardless of whether these technologies focus on health or another domain. Use of these models complements ethnographic methods, by either framing the sets of questions to ask during a study, or by providing a post-hoc lens for data analysis. To illustrate how these models can be used in practice, we show how the integrated behavior model can provide insight into domestic technology usage practices.",,

The first is the complex relationship between finances and self-identity, relationships, and family. Second, we discuss the tools and processes people used to keep track of their financial situation. The third set presents how people account for the unknown and unpredictable nature of the future through their financial decisions. We conclude implications for the design of tools to aid people in better managing their money, and discuss the future of studies of money and finance in CSCW.",,

We examine the diffusion of these moods through the characteristics of the author of the retweeted post, of the post, and its linguistic style and topical content. We observe that moods of high valence and low to moderate activation propagate the most. Our findings also indicate that mood-bearing posts from individuals of medium #followers show highest diffusion, instead of elite users. Further, moods in postings with high self-attentional focus, posted by socially interactive women, and with fewer links diffuse the most. Finally, we leverage these characteristics to build a linear regression model that can predict degree of diffusion in a mood-bearing post. The model yields accuracy of 75% showing that user’s attributes as well as post’s language characteristics are key factors driving the diffusion of moods in social media.",,

In story writing, the diverse perspectives of the crowd could support an author’s search for the perfect character, setting, or plot. However, too little structure for the crowd leads to unfocused, sprawling narratives, and too much structure stifles creativity. Motivated by the idea that individual creative leaders and the crowd have complementary creative strengths, we present an approach where a leader directs the high-level vision for a story and articulates creative constraints for the crowd. This approach is manifest in Ensemble, a novel collaborative story-writing platform. In a month-long short story competition, over one hundred volunteer users on the web began more than fifty short stories using Ensemble. Leaders used the platform to direct collaborator work by establishing creative goals, and collaborators contributed meaningful, high-level ideas to stories through targeted suggestions. This work suggests that asymmetric creative contributions may support a broad new class of creative collaborations.",,

Crowdfunding lessens this risk by only calling in donations when an effort reaches a collective goal. However, it leaves unsolved the harder problem of mobilizing time and effort. We generalize the concept into activation thresholds, commitments that are conditioned on others’ participation: supporters only need to show up if enough other people commit as well. We present Catalyst, which introduces activation thresholds for on-demand events. For complex coordination needs, Catalyst also includes thresholds for time and role. Catalyst users have organized events including volunteering, on-demand study groups, and mass participation events like a human chess game.

Using a case study of R, a popular data analysis software, we investigate how mailing list participation has evolved since the launch of StackExchange.

This paper introduces an experiment where native (NS) and non-native speakers (NNS) rate the emotional tone of real text-based messages written by native English speaking authors. NNS were less accurate at detecting the emotions in messages compared to NS, especially in the absence of highly positive or negative words. NNS accuracy improved when the English messages were long but reduced when replies to the original messages were included as additional contextual information. Instead of making use of non-verbal cues, such as emoticons in messages and replies, NNS relied on a wide range of objective words and expressions to determine the emotional tone of each message. The results are used to inform the design of supporting tools for multilingual communication and intercultural collaboration. ",,

We created a prototype implementation of the whole system. The experimental results show that our solution provides reliable task migration on a video stream in interactive frame rates (30+ FPS). This substantially outperforms the existing solutions based on natural keypoints. We carried out a user study as well as empirical evaluation tests.

The paper describes how they use Facebook (FB), newspapers and TV for gaining information and for exchange. FB is their primary medium for access to political information. They prefer the variety and diversity of user-generated content, they select information by themselves, discuss among their friends inside FB and with that, co-create meaning and trust. It seems that both the traditional censorship in the national mass media and the revolutionary experience created a unique media landscape among young Tunisians.

Amateurs skew towards higher scores, but are the primary source of low scores; that is, they show considerably more variance. However, both groups express the same average levels of sentiment. Finally, regressing future videogame sales on reviews, we find that a combination of professional scores, volume of professional reviews, and volume of amateur reviews provides a moderately powerful predictive model for future game sales.

We propose a multilingual case method education system for global classroom, which gives international students the opportunity to share their case discussions in their native language. With our system, international students communicate in their native language through machine translation services in a cloud computing environment. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted experiments, in which American, Korean and Japanese students participated, and analyzed the cultural similarities and differences as diversity resulting from computer-mediated case discussions. We found that it is quite possible to conduct case discussions to exchange views with this system. The system has an advantage in determining cultural diversity and encouraging a diverse global perspective.",,

A 2x2 (human and AI team-mate; Independent / Interdependent condition) between-subjects experiment was conducted with 60 participants playing a real-time cooperative computer game. The main results are that when team-mates are perceived to have an interdependent relationship, people respond more similarly to human and computer team-mates in terms of behavior towards them and the amount of attention paid. The results suggest that designing to increase player structural interdependence can decrease the difference in how human players treat their human and AI team-mates.",,

These websites also seek to coordinate donations so that each project receives enough money to actually succeed. Each crowdfunding project sets a goal for donations required and a deadline in which to receive them. Crowdfunding site designers must decide what to do with donations to projects that don't reach their goal by the deadline. Some crowdfunding sites use an all-or-nothing return rule in which donations are returned to donors if a project doesn't met its goal. Other sites use a direct donation structure where all donations are kept by the project even if the total is insufficient.  Using a lab experiment that simulates a crowdfunding website, we find that the return rule mechanism leads to a marginal improvement in productivity, but a considerable loss in efficiency.

Based on an interview study, we illustrate how technology is used to deliver the sought-after fantasy and a practical, yet entertaining, affair. We identify four main ways that technology helps people do this: (a) by allowing much of the practical planning work to become “invisible;” (b) by easing navigation through the delicate rules of family configurations made manifest in the guest list; (c) by helping create a spectacle-like event that adroitly balances excess and realism; and (d) by documenting the wedding in ways that allows re-experiencing the magic after the event. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this pursuit on social graphs, place, and photography, contributing to the literature on technology and major life events.",,

The analysis indicates that a wide range of behavioural responses is evident, extending beyond the choice of route, mode of transport. We identify the two most prevalent ways for mitigating the impacts of disruption; time buffering and the use of kinship networks.

We examined the effects of both forums and reputation systems on student course outcomes and student-forum interactions. Results show that use of forums in MOOCs is correlated with better grades and higher retention, and that reputation systems produce faster response times and larger numbers of responses per post, as well as differences in how students ask questions. On the other hand, reputation systems have no significant impact on grades, retention, or the students' subjective sense of community. This suggests that forums are essential for MOOCs, and reputation systems can improve the forum experience, but other techniques are needed to improve student outcomes and community formation.

In the fifteen years since these studies appeared, the technologies used in CVEs have improved substantially. What these advances mean for the problems of fragmentation and deictic gesture, however, is unclear. We conducted an observational study of deictic pointing in a CVE with techniques that may reduce fragmentation: extra-wide and third-person views, precise control over an avatar’s pointing arm, and visual enhancements such as object highlighting and laser pointing. Our study shows that although pointing has come a long way, problems of fragmentation still occur, and that visual and view enhancements can cause new problems for collaboration, even as they solve others.

In this work, we investigate how these two factors may facilitate or hinder inter-group interactions in the workplace. We analyse traces collected using wearable electronic badges to capture face-to-face interactions and mobility patterns of employees in a research laboratory in the UK. We observe that those who interact with people of different roles tend to come from collectivist and person-oriented cultures comfortable with social hierarchies, and that some locations in particular are more likely to host serendipitous interactions, knowledge that could be used by organisations to enhance communication and productivity.",,

Recent research showed that these kinds of encounters can successfully be supported with IT-artifacts. Tabletop scenarios, for example, can increase the transparency of the advisory process for the customers. In this line of research, however, we also experienced that the relationship quality as experienced by the customer can suffer severely when IT artifacts are introduced in the advisory scenario. Based on these experiences, we developed guidelines to avoid this effect and implemented them in one of our prototypes. The evaluation reveals that these measures proved to be effective. With the reported study, we seek to enhance our design knowledge on IT-supported advisory scenarios with a special focus on relationship building. In a larger context, we argue that the use of IT during sensitive face-to-face encounters will be of growing significance in the future but is hardly understood, yet. With our generic requirements, design principles and evaluation, we make a contribution in this area. ",,

We analyze a publicly available dataset about Facebook non-use that includes data from 410 respondents. We apply statistical modeling to determine what factors predict both enacted non-use, in terms of a respondent either deactivating or deleting her or his account, as well as considered non-use, in terms of how often a respondent reports considering account deactivation or deletion. Results show that a variety of factors predict increased, or in some cases decreased, likelihood of non-use, including concerns about privacy, the Facebook features a respondent most frequently uses, and whether a respondent knows someone else who left Facebook. These results contribute to our understanding of non-use by examining motivations for, and potential indicators of, social technology non-use. This paper also highlights the sociotechnical ramifications of becoming a non-user and the ways in which non-use is a highly social phenomenon.",,

To test this question the present study separated people from their phone while they waited for a flu shot, a potentially anxiety-producing event. According to attachment theory, phone attached individuals should experience separation distress and rate the upcoming flu shot as more painful than unattached individuals. The results supported this prediction: high phone attachment individuals anticipated more pain than low phone attachment individuals when separated from their phone. We also found that high phone attachment individuals were more likely to be younger and to own a smartphone than a regular phone; we found no difference between genders. Our results extend self-reported perceptions of phone attachment by demonstrating that phone separation can activate key attachment behaviors, such as separation distress.",,

When we design for home-based healthcare we need a deep understanding of the home and everyday life healthcare activities to balance inflow of design rationales from healthcare workplaces, like hospitals, and from home-based leisure, like games. To help designers of everyday home-based healthcare, we present and discuss four concerns (why, when, where and control in collaboration) that emerged in our analysis of challenges in three of our projects. In our experience these concerns help designers to focus on aspects where design rationales from healthcare workplaces and leisure respectively are not sufficient and may even point in other directions than what is helpful for home-based healthcare.",,

We designed a location-based game called GEMS to support telling and sharing stories and to enhance knowledge of place amongst family and friends. The game narrative and mechanics prompt players to reflect on meaningful places from their past and travel to those places to create geolocated digital memory records that capture the personal significance of the places in question.

Overall, the game site activity was not reduced – but we saw a variety of different effects in subgroups within the community.

The understanding of people's choice to communication channels is becoming quite important. In this paper, we specifically selected two of the most significant channels as the objects for comparison. One is online social network, e.g., Twitter as representative of such networks, and another is mobile telecommunication. The corresponded social network is therefore constructed for each communication channel.

We created a visualization tool to aid system-on-a-chip teams to make data-backed decisions about which external intellectual property they should use when planning to design a chip. We then generalize this visualization tool, and entitle it The Blueprint Model. Through a formative investigation, working digital prototype, and a tie to empirical work/theory in visualization and design, The Blueprint Model was developed. The key attributes of The Blueprint Model are interactivity, closeness of mapping, overview+detail, and incorporating a decision-matrix backend. We advocate the use of The Blueprint Model by work groups who are striving to make data-backed decisions about a system that has physical components that can be tied to the real world. ",,

Therefore, it is important to understand the temporal nature of volunteers’ motivations and their effect on participation practices, so that effective partnerships between volunteers and scientists can be established. This paper presents case studies of longitudinal participation practices in citizen science in three countries – the United States, India, and Costa Rica. The findings reveal a temporal process of participation, in which initial participation stems in most cases from self-directed motivations. In contrast, long-term participation becomes much more complex and includes both self-directed motivations and collaborative motivations.",,

We describe our dataset of 682 Facebook users, their attachment scale survey results, and their 657,057 posts. We define four key features: social capacity, openness, self-disclosure, and emotional disclosure. By analyzing the two dimensions of attachment, anxiousness and avoidance using the four key features, we find significant correlations between the users' attachment style and their Facebook behaviors. The implication is that a computational analysis of a Facebook user's activities alone can reveal the attachment style of that user without the self-reported survey questionnaire of attachment scale.

The file-based ‘physical’ organization needs to be extended with linked storage to associate individual digital artifacts with multiplicity of their representations used across project maps. The logical organization of digital collections, such as ‘placeless’ information storage, needs to be extended with sophisticated reference resolution service to differentiate between semantic links and access links. The latter reflects the finding that project maps comprise reused content that may be imbedded, linked to, or disconnected from the related digital artifacts. We propose an extendible service-based information architecture that can also enforce diverse content access preferences in a collaborative work environment. ",,

This paper uses methods from social network analysis and bibliometrics to re-examine the structures of CSCW a decade after its last systematic analysis. Using data from the ACM Digital Library, we analyze changes in structures of coauthorship and citation between 1986 and 2013. Statistical models reveal significant but distinct patterns between papers and authors in how brokerage and closure in these networks affects impact as measured by citations and downloads. Specifically, impact is unduly influenced by structural position, such that ideas introduced by those in the core of the CSCW community (e.g., elite researchers) are advantaged over those introduced by peripheral participants (e.g., newcomers).  This finding is examined in the context of recent changes to the CSCW conference that may have the effect of upseting the preference for contributions from the core.  ",,

It requires not only the system deployment, but also an integration of the system into the reality of patient care practices that includes its social and technological environment. While most previous work focus on the adoption and adaptation of the system after EMR implementation, we found clinicians in our study site engaged in proactive and collaborative reflections in order to identify and address current workflow deficiencies and be better prepared for the upcoming EMR rollout. Doing so not only helped clinicians better understand the operation, but also unexpectedly helped build a stronger and a more cohesive community through reflecting on each other’s work. We argue that collaborative reflection can help enhance the technology readiness of a health organization and its staff, particularly for an EMR system.",,

In our research we found that context often depended the providers’ situation or the patient being examined, which implies that there are two types of context – patient-centric and provider-centric – that affect provider technology use.

The system implements a ``triadic interview'' interaction since it is used as a focus point between the child and the clinician, whose dialogue is mediated by the tool. The tool helps children express their feelings and experiences, by making use of an ``emotion palette'' and a set of sub-tools developed on paper by children and transformed into computer-based depictions. The tool is fully developed and is currently used by a significant number of clinicians worldwide.  Extensive feedback concerning its use in practice provides us with evaluation data that we  report here.  The results indicate that the tool provides a level of support to the end users that improves upon traditional, non computer-based methods of interaction within the therapy setting. \ ",,

Further, we investigate whether peer reviewing may be more effective in teams where the reviewers can reach consensus through discussion. An online between-subjects experiment compares the tradeoffs of reviewing versus producing work using three different organization strategies: working individually, working in an interactive team, and aggregating individuals into nominal groups. The results show that workers who review others’ work perform better on subsequent tasks than workers who just produce. We also find that interactive reviewer teams outperform individual reviewers on all quality measures. However, aggregating individual reviewers into nominal groups produces better quality assessments than interactive teams, except in task domains where discussion helps overcome individual misconceptions.

Patterns of responsiveness to requests for help are important because they have the potential to affect users’ overall satisfaction with the experience of using SNSs, signal social grooming functions that are an essential part of relationship maintenance, and affect the generation and cultivation of social capital. In this paper, we study a corpus of public status updates posted to Facebook (N=7,466) in order to identify patterns of activity around and linguistic characteristics of status updates that attempt to mobilize resources from the poster’s Facebook network. We find that posts attempting to mobilize help from their network receive more comments than non-mobilization attempts and that those comments were contributed more quickly.  The type of support requested (e.g. a recommendation vs. a favor) also impacted engagement with original posts, ultimately signaling new opportunities for SNSs to support these help-seeking behaviors and social capital conversion.",,

Information other users share about one another can have significant impact on impression formation, and can sometimes threaten one’s self-presentation goals, making the process challenging. These challenges are further exacerbated because social network sites tend to obscure the audience cues on which the self-presentation process typically depends. However, we know little about the nature of other-generated face threats and the ways that people perceive them. Using an online survey of 150 Facebook users, we report on what users consider to be other-generated face threats and how they feel after experiencing them. Results suggest that many face threats result from a lack of care or misunderstanding of another person’s audience and/or self-presentation goals, or a fear of creating an unwanted association with another Facebook user.

We found the visualizations had differential impacts on people with varied levels of motivation for accurately learning the topic. Specifically, the visualization promoted selection of sources that were moderately inconsistent with their existing attitudes for people who had high accuracy motives, thus increased their exposure to attitude challenging information; but not for those who had low accuracy motives. The visualization also helped people differentiate between sources with moderate and extreme positions, and increased their agreement with information from the moderately inconsistant sources. By increasing the exposure to attitude challenging information, users with high accuracy motives were also found to learn significantly more about the arguments put forward by the opposite side with the visualization. Implications for designing systems that encourage exposure to diverse information and common ground seeking were discussed.",,

By means of a proxy-technology assessment, a number of challenges for telesurgery have been identified. These include the unfamiliarity of the remote surgeon with the practices of the local operating room team and the patient. In addition, verbal and non-verbal communication has to be mediated in a telesurgery setting, making it harder for the remote surgeon to have an overview and stay in control during surgery.

Results show that during the collaborative discovery on interactive tabletops, gender and racial diversities, while directly influenced collaboration styles and processes, did not impact team performance. Diversity attributes that directly correlated with team effectiveness included differences in tabletop use experiences, usability ratings, and the frequency of suggestions not being accepted.

We then look at the effects of interacting with deviant players, including effects on retention. We find that toxic players have several significant predictive patterns, such as playing in more competitive game modes and playing with friends.

As a result, it seems prudent to explore crowdwork in relation to the nature of work in organizational practice to ascertain the implications of crowdsourcing on organizational structures, human requirements and work efficiency. This paper argues that a more profound reckoning of the nature of work itself and a broader conceptualization of crowdwork that accommodates the inherent complexity of work is needed to address these challenges.

Merging the theory of legitimate peripheral participation with Erickson and Kellogg’s theory of social translucence we introduce the concept of practice proxies; traces of user activities in online environment that act as resources to orient newcomers towards the norms of practice. Our findings suggest that newcomers seek out practice proxies in the social features of the projects that highlight contextualized and specific characteristics of primary work practice. ,,

We learned that Twitter interactions were mostly short and about current situation happening around physical spaces. However, despite the bursty form, status updates promote awareness between the remote places as well as initiate casual encounters. We discuss how these results can be used to think about new combinations, i.e. mashups of popular digital media, like video-chats, social media, streamed media, and games to form new media that are noted, used and enjoyed. Another opportunity is to develop research methods to study new forms of communication using hybrid media mashups",,

The theory also states that one of the main reasons behind such behavior is the sense of accountability that accompanies making individual level information public. We present a study designed to investigate whether the effects of Social Translucence theory can coexist with anonymity and if group conformity occurs even without individual level information being made public.

We used real-time sociometric data to measure collaboration dynamics, and the effect of environment on creativity and collaboration outcomes. Findings indicate that the affordances of VICED fundamentally change collaborative dynamics by increasing turn-taking and successful interrupts, as well as participation equity, creating a more collaborative dynamic in design teams. Enhanced turn-taking is indicative of elaboration, an important construct of creativity as well as collaboration. Findings also suggest that VICED affordances positively affect collaboration quality and creative fluency, but not the experience of creative flow.",,

And plans establish common baselines of expectation around and against which local choice and action may be calibrated.

This connection ability increased the number of people that can be found on social networks, but the tradeoff is the huge amount of people who came to participate in this search process, making it extremely complex. In this paper, grounded in the concepts of Science of Networks and Artificial Intelligence, we construct models and algorithms aiming to produce a search engine to be integrated in environments representative of social networks, such as online social networks. The differential of this mechanism is its ability to evaluate the numerous paths that connect source and target people, opting for the one where the interpersonal influence is maximized, which increases the probability of connecting people involved. In order to simulate its operation, we implement the mechanism in an application which owns results that exceeded original expectations.",,
