- instructions and login (with email address, just like Cascade@CHI)
- extreme logging/instrumentation for later analysis
- being able to dynamically control the list of papers in the system while we are in the PC meeting
- being able to get a dump from PCS and only show the Frenzy activity with officially accepted papers.
- prepare the interface for both phases ( tagging party with ~100 people, and session making with ~15 people)
- show the abstracts in a show/hide thing
- watchlist to focus users on the data they care about, so as not to overwhelm them.
- text search
- for session making, show both absolute # of items in categories AND the number not in sessions.
- sorting search results but most/least active items
- make the hyperbar seem like it has fixed position.

Done:
- getting the feed to not jump
(should refresh only refresh that item?)
