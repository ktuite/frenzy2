- instructions and login (with email address, just like Cascade@CHI)
- extreme logging/instrumentation for later analysis

- being able to dynamically control the list of papers in the system while we are in the PC meeting
- being able to get a dump from PCS and only show the Frenzy activity with officially accepted papers.

- prepare the interface for both phases ( tagging party with ~100 people, and session making with ~15 people)

- watchlist to focus users on the data they care about, so as not to overwhelm them.

- for session making, show both absolute # of items in categories AND the number not in sessions.
- sorting search results but most/least active items
- make the hyperbar seem like it has fixed position.

- when I do a text search, the search term should highlight.
- way to see all the items

Medium prioity:

- delete category (or just leave as unchecked)
    - resort category list in the items (unchecked at bottom)
- feedback indicating that the session has been removed from the item.
- errors with toggling categories (probably having to do with having a list that's populated funky, "Studies Of Wikipedia" is checked but not on the list because of the way I scraped.)
- should I only show currently applicable categories for when the subset of the data is done.

Done:
- getting the feed to not jump
(should refresh only refresh that item?)
- show the abstracts in a show/hide thing
- global text search
(should highlight text, and expand abstracts)
- don't add null categories
- when I click a category name, both abstracts shouldn't show up.
- how do I remove an item from session?
- session updating when I update it.
